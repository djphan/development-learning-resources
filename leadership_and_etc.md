### Leadership and Teaching Resources
* [6 Things Your Junior Devs Don't Tell You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6G8f9pZZRM)
  * Duration: 30 Minutes
  * TLDR - Summary of Points:
    * [Juniors] have no idea what is going to happen (i.e. there is a large element of uncertainty presented to the Junior Devs) and as the teaching dev can help by **mitigating this** in the early months
      * Action: Onboarding plans/structure to help guide juniors to success
    * [Juniors] are conditioned to not bother you (and not bother you during the day to day writing code)
      * Action: Try and set some time aside for allow for Q&As and an open space for the Juniors
    * [Juniors] are not confident of their work via impostor syndrome 
      * Action: Share experience, and give clear/relevant feedback to the Junior
    * [Juniors] get bored too [with the menial work]
       * Action: Assign deliberate and functional work to help juniors develop in their careers â€“ not just the small cases
    * [Juniors] know about what you think about them (e.g. senior devs will leave an impression on the juniors)
      * Action: Excuse yourself from teaching juniors if you do not have a mindset to teach them and give them a chance
      * Action: Note that Juniors will adapt and mimic and take cues from your actions/impressions so lead by example
    * [Juniors] are only as good as you are (see above)
      * Action: When juniors screw up, don't berate them. Take the time to encourage growth from these experiences
